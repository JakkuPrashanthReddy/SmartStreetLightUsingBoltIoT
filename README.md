# SmartStreetLight
I have observed many times in my village that someone turns ON streetlights in the evening but no one turns OFF at The right time in the morning so that this leads to not only wastage of electricity but also reduces the lifetime of that lights so In this way this project came to my mind. This is a Smart Street Light Project. This device Turns ON and Turns OFF Street Lights based on the Light Intensity Available at that Location and Notifies the Department which takes care of These street lights via a Telegram Channel about the state of street lights and also stores the Sensor value and Timestamp in a CSV file for the Verification purposes. This device not only Controls the light but also saves electricity and increases the lifetime of StreetLights by changing the state of Lights in the right situation.
